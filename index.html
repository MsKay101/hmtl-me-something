                        When you hear about cruise boats you think "What a great time!", That would be so nice 
                    to be away from home, "Oh how I would love to get away". Me on the other hand I would think
                    oh that would be nice , but I'm scared thinking about the water and not seeing land. So 
                    for me to over come my fear I booked my first cruise to see excatly how it would be.</p>

                      <p> 
                          At first I was all excited and pumped to go on the boat, all I could think about was I'm 
                    finally going to Jamaica somewhere I always wanted to go. I wasn't thinking about the boat
                    or how long it would take to get there all I wanted to do was be in Jamaica (lol). Then when 
                    I started asking questions about the cruise I found out I would be a straight land for 2 days 
                    until we arrived at the first stop OMG, NO land or grass for 48hrs what was I going to do. That
                    is when I started having second thoughts about the whole cruise thing. I wanted to cancel I told
                    everyone they could take my spot , I looked into cancelling, and etc. My mother on the other hand
                    told me no I would just have to suck it up and go. </p>

                      <p> 
                          When time came to go I started getting more exciting and scared also. That gut feeling wouldn't 
                    shake for anything . Upon arrving at the dock I could feel the butterflies get stronger my anxiety
                    starting getting worse all I wanted to do was come back home ; but to late now I was there and 
                    no turning back. At first I was eeewww what is this the boat was weird looking it was like a big oh
                    circle or in my sister words "Hotel on Water" . After being on the boat for a few days I started to 
                     enjoy myself my fear started fading away more and more . When I finally made it to Jamaica that is when
                    all fear, butterflies, anxiety went out the window. It was I wasn't scare or nervous anymore all the beautiful
                    palm trees, the food, the people it was like a totally different world. "Aww" I didn't want to come back.</p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, the experiecene was great even though I was terrified at first I had a great time . All the food
                    you can eat and drinks was one of the greatest parts cause I love to eat . I would differently love to take
                    another cruise or just go back to Jamaica again. In the end I suggest every one take a cruise once in their life.</p>
